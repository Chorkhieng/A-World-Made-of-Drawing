To ensure this graphic work smoothly, use `Google Chrome` or `Microsoft Edge`

## Link to Github Page

Use this link to play the simulation: https://chorkhieng.github.io/A-World-Made-of-Drawing/  

Use GUI on the top right corner of the page to interact with the simulation.

## Drawing Strokes

| Stroke Made by Mouse                     | 3D Modeling Operation                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Starts in the sky                        | Add a new stroke to the sky                      |
| Starts AND ends on the ground            | Edit the ground mesh to create hills and valleys |
| Starts on the ground and ends in the sky | Create a new billboard                           |
| Starts on an existing billboard          | Add the stroke to the existing billboard         |
